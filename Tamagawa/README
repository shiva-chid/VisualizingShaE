Tamagawa numbers in Magma - by Raymond van Bommel

The package Tamagawa_pkg2.m is supposed to be attached to Magma, using the Attach command.
The file magma-diff.txt described the changes I made to the regular models package.
Many cases will work fine without these changes; only in the case when there are not enough subfields an error will be raised.
The intrinsic TamagawaNumber can be called on a regular model to compute the Tamagawa numbers.
